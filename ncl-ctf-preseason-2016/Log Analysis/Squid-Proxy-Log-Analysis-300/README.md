__In what year was this log saved?__

With this question, let's start by looking at the first line of the access log.

```
1286536308.779    180 192.168.0.224 TCP_MISS/200 411 GET http://liveupdate.symantecliveupdate.com/minitri.flg - DIRECT/125.23.216.203 text/plain
```

We can see that the first few numbers represent the time. Since Squid is a Linux Proxy, this time is in Epoch. So all I did was go online to [EpochConverter](http://www.epochconverter.com/) and converted the time. You should get something similar to what I have below.
