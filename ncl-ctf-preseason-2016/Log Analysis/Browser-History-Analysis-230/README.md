For this challenge we are provided the following file: [NCL-2016-Pre-Firefox.sqlite](https://jhalon.github.io/download/NCL-2016-Pre-Firefox.sqlite)

You must download the file and open it up in a SQL database to solve the challenge. I used the [SQLite Viewer](http://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/) online to access this information.

Once you have the SQL Database uploaded you will be presented with a page like so.

Once you are there, we need to navigate to the users browser history. So we will select __moz_palces__ from the dropdown.

You will be presented with the screen below... When you arrive at that screen, we will now be able to look for the answers to our questions.

__Answer: coinbase__

__What is the email that was used to log into the exchange?__

Since we don't see any login data - let's look for known emails. Line 268 shows us that he is logging into a gmail account. We can assume that he is using this to verify his bitcoin exchange.
